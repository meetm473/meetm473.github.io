I have built this rover to experiment with different things in simulation in the future. The Gazebo world is designed to match the Martian atmospheric conditions as close as possible. I have referred to [this](https://grabcad.com/library/nasa-designed-rocker-bogie-rover-1) model from GrabCAD for modeling the bot.
