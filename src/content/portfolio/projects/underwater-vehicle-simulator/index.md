I was a part of the [**Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Society**](https://auviiitdm.github.io/) in my undergrad. I was in the Electronics team and led the development of simulator to assist the team in testing our control, and computer vision algorithms on simulation prior to hardware testing. The development of this simulator took place during the COVID - 19 pandemic. We published our work at the OCEANS 2021 conference  <ins>([link to the paper](https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS44145.2021.9705822))</ins>.
