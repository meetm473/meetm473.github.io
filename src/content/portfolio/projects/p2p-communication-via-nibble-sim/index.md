<h2 class="text-2xl">Overview</h2>

**nibble-sim** is a simulator to implement peer-to-peer communication strategies between 4^n nodes in a network. The simulator is designed to incorporate any P2P protocol. Currently, only a circular distributed hash table is implemented on the simulator. Navigate through the following pages to learn the basics of P2P network, and distributed hash tables, followed by a bird's eye view of the simulator (**nibble-sim**), and then finally the detailed internal structure of the simulator. One can download the project from [**Github**](https://github.com/DCN-project/nibble-sim.git) and execute the python source file following the instructions in the README files.

Detailed notes on the topic can be found [**here**](https://github.com/DCN-project/nibble-sim/blob/master/docs/Home.md).
